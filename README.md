# Current progress of the game

*video location*

# What's my vision
- I want to achieve semi-accurate souls-like gameplay
- Achieve to give the gladiator arena vibe
- To scale the project for a steam release or remaster it to be a competent game on the market

# Future ideas
- 6-7 unique bosses (before them at least 3 base enemy types so 12-14 different base enemies)
- Abilities, spells, mystical weapons dropped by bosses
- Leveling up
- Secret boss fight from a quest
- Having the ability to respec your levels to try out different builds
- Including at least 10 different weapons excluding the bosses weapons
